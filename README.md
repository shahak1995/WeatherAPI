# WeatherAPI
### Description
This code helps to call the weather API using the HTTParty, gets the data from the website and retrieves it by turning parsing it into a JSON file. Once this is retrieved, the test are done to check each of the elements within the hashes and arrays of the data to see if it is the right data type. Once all the test is done, through the use of RSpec, the test are run to see if they pass or not through the use of Red and Green; Red being a failure and Green being it has passed.

### Challenges (you can include images and code block here)
1. Testing the 5 day weather forecast data
2. Doing the loops for the spec and service files
3. Hiding the API Key through the use of ENV
